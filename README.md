Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? In order to assist them financially, Artemis Financila need software that sends and receives information from its subscribers. Since this information is sensitive, it is crucial to maintain it encrypted. The company asked me to identify security flaws in their program and make improvements to reduce the risks in order to make it a more secure application for sending and receiving this information.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing? Maven made it simple for me to create a vulnerability report, and I improved upon those risks by figuring out how to lower vulnerability risks.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful? It was challenging for me to locate the procedures necessary to do the assignment. Because there aren't any explicit instructions on how to perform the work, I had to undertake research and divide it into smaller components. The ability to obtain useful information that will direct me to a solution is what I found to be beneficial. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques? First I saw what the current risks are and began on improving thse one by one. After that i looked to make their site HTTPS which helps reduce risk as well.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? I run the software myself and checked it to make sure that it functions as it did when I first received the source. I ran another Maven report to check if any modifications had been made to determine if I had introduced a new vulnerability.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks? I utilized Maven to look for vulnerabilities and read descriptions on their nature and how they work.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer? By conducting study and learning more about what I am doing, I would like to highlight my capacity for analysis and forging ahead through challenges. By having code that works and adheres to the rules of coding, I would also like to emphasize functionality and effectiveness.
